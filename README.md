# WordCounter

## Running the Program

In the terminal, run **python main.py**. Respond to the following prompts.

This program was run in Python 3.6.3 with Anaconda.

Necessary Python libraries: docx, unidecode, re, csv,
pprint, termcolor, os, glob, sys

To run with your own files, create the folder **docs** in the main directory with two subfolders: **full** and **groups**.

**full** should have .docx files in it. These are the files you want to read from to count the words inside them.

**groups** should have .csv files in it. These are the files you will use to define the words you want to count. Included already are .csv files for colors, common words, and male and female words. There is an option to choose a .csv file for character names or to input character names in the terminal that you want to count.
